Our full summer schedule starts this weekend, including an outdoor aikido weapons class!
We will meet on the [grassy area SE corner of Weill Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hUL9hPsSmMXpZxDV8){:target="_blank"}.

Please wear approporiate casual clothing (no keiko-gi required) and hat if it's sunny. We will have extra weapons for anyone who does not have their own.

Classes may cover aiki-jo kata, aikido basics with bokken, and other basic solo and paired practice. We hope to see you there!
