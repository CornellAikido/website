Starting September 15, the aikido club will run a four week beginners class.

The schedule will be:
* Tue/Thu - 7:00-8:00pm
* Sat - 12:30-2pm

Class will be held in the gynmastics room on the second floor of Teagle Hall.

No prior experience is needed, and all fitness levels can be accommodated. That said, any prior martial arts knowledge can aid beginners in picking up Aikido techniques and concepts quickly.

No special clothing is required, but sweatpants that cover the knees may be preferred. If you have a judo gi or similar, feel free to wear that.
