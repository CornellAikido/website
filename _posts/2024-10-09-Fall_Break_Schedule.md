Fall break is coming up, and Teagle Hall building hours will change. Luckily, this will only affect one of our classes:

 - 10/10 Th:  7pm (no change)
 - 10/12 Sa:  12:30pm (no change)
 - 10/13 Su:  12:30pm (no change)
 - 10/15 Tu:  4:45pm (get in before the building closes!)
 - 10/17 Th:  7pm (no change)

A reminder that our seminar is coming up on Saturday Oct 19th!
There may be a weapons class using bokken.
This Saturday's class will include a quick introduction to bokken if you are unfamiliar with it.
