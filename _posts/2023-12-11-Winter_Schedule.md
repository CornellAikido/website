On October 22nd, we will have a beginners-focused seminar with three of our instructors.
This will be held in our regular training space, Gymnastics Room (2F), Teagle Hall, Cornell University.

Students can take part in all three classes or attend only those that their schedule allows.
It's a long day, so sitting out for a bit to watch and catch your breath is acceptable.

Visitors are encouraged to attend and/or watch, however no minors from outside Cornell cannot participate on the mats.

The schedule will be:

**Sunday, Oct. 22**
  * 12:30-1:30pm - Lamont Sensei, 3rd dan (ukemi training)
  * 1:45-2:45pm - Katagiri Sensei, 7th dan Shihan
  * 3:00-4:00pm - Hinrichs Sensei, 2nd dan (tanto techniques)
  * 4pm - Refreshments
