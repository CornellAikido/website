Come meet us at Club Fest in the Arts Quad on Sunday, September 11.

Tentatively, we plan to have a demonstration of an Aikido class and show off some more advanced Aikido on Tuesday September 13 at 7:30pm in our regular training space, 2nd floor of Teagle Hall at 7:30pm. All are welcome to come watch and sign up for our beginners classes, starting soon after.
