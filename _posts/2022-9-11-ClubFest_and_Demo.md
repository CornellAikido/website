**Sunday, Sept 11, Art Quad:**
* Come meet us at Club Fest!

**Tuesday, Sept 13, 7:30pm, Teagle Hall:**
* Tentatively, we plan to have a demonstration of an Aikido class and show off some more advanced Aikido. This will be held in our regular training space, the gynmastics room on the **2nd floor of Teagle Hall**. All are welcome to come watch and sign up for our beginners classes, starting soon after.
