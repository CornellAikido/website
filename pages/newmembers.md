Here are some questions that the club often receives from those who have just
begun or are looking to begin Aikido training. If you have a question which is
not answered here, please [contact us](/contact/).

### What is Aikido?

Aikido (合気道) is a moderen Japanese martial art which emphasizes blending
and redirecting the force of an opponent's attack. Techniques taught are primarily
defensive, and include a variety of joint locks and timing throws. Students
practice both against unarmed opponents and with traditional martial arts weapons.

Aikido can be roughly translated as "the way of unifying life energy."

[Click here](/about-aikido/) for a more in-depth explanation of the history and principles of Aikido.

### What do I need to begin training?

- If you do not own a keikogi, we recommend comfortable clothing for your first
  handful of practices. A t-shirt and sweatpants will do just fine. If you
  decide to continue with Aikido, keikogis can be purchased from the club at a
  discounted price.
  
- The club requires all members to sign the Cornell athletics liability waiver
  before they can begin practice. It is not strictly necessary to fill out a
  waiver ahead of time, you can also get one at practice.

- New members can attend their first handful of practices free of charge! If you
  do decide to join the club, the registration fee for the year is $70, with a
  $10 late fee if it is not paid by the registration deadline (the deadline
  changes from year to year, check the [front page](/) for an announcement
  regarding the current deadline).

- Make sure you have read the [rules for Aikido practice](/aikido-rules/). In
  particular, an optimistic attitude and an open mind are essential.
