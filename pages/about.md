## What is Aikido?
Aikido (合気道) is a moderen Japanese martial art which emphasizes blending
and redirecting the force of an opponent's attack. Techniques taught are primarily
defensive, and include a variety of joint locks and timing throws. Students
practice both against unarmed opponents and with traditional martial arts weapons.

Aikido can be roughly translated as "the way of unifying life energy."
