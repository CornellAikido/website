### Cornell Aikido Club
Welcome to Cornell Aikido Club.  

Aikido (合気道) is a Japanese martial art which emphasizes blending with and redirecting the force
of an opponent's attack.

Aikido can be roughly translated as "the way of unifying life energy."

Cornell Aikido Club is a non-credit university sports club.  
We are affiliated with the [United States Aikido Federation (USAF)](http://www.usaikifed.com/) and Aikido Headquarters Hombu Dojo in Tokyo, Japan.
