# Welcome!
The Cornell Aikido Club offers Aikido instruction and training for all levels.
New members are accepted year-round! If you are new to Aikido or just want to
brush up on the basics, the club offers a beginner's class at the beginning of
every fall semester.

Normally, our practice times are:

- Tuesday and Thursday 7:00 - 8:30 pm
- Saturday and Sunday 12:30 - 2:00 pm

but please check the [announcements](#announcements) below for irregular hours and
schedule changes. Classes are held in [Teagle Hall](https://www.cornell.edu/about/maps/?loc=Teagle%20Hall)'s
gymnasium on the second floor. Please arrive 5 minutes early to help set up the
room and warm up. If you arrive even earlier and see the gymnastics team is
still using the gymnasium, please wait outside for them to finish.

Additionally, club members are eligible for classes at [Finger Lakes
Aikido](http://www.fingerlakesaikido.com/) free of charge!

# Announcements

- **Thu. 01/26/17:** We're now fully back on our normal schedule:
  Tue/Thu: 7:00-8:30pm
  Sat/Sun: 12:30-2:00pm

As we often do, the first three weeks of the spring semester will be
"basics" time - focusing on core concepts and movements, to get back in the
flow after winter break. If you've been away from practice for a while,
this is a great time to come back!

Dues for the spring semester are $70. Additionally, if you are a US Aikido
Federation member (i.e. you have taken a kyu or dan test), please add $20,
for the annual federation dues. (The total cost is $45, but the club will
contribute $25.)

I hope to see you on the mats soon!

- **Sat. 01/21/17:** Starting on Tuesday (1/24), our Tue/Thu practices will resume, at their
normal time: 7:00-8:30pm.
- **Thu. 12/22/16:** Tonight's class is the last one of 2016. Classes will still
be offered during the holidays at Finger Lakes Aikido on Mondays and Fridays.
