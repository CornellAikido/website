## Welcome!
The Cornell Aikido Club offers Aikido instruction and training for all levels.
New members are accepted year-round! If you are new to Aikido or just want to
brush up on the basics, the club offers a beginner's class at the beginning of
every fall semester.

Our regular weekly hours are:

- Tuesday and Thursday 7:00 - 8:30 pm
- Saturday and Sunday 12:30 - 2:00 pm

Classes are held in [Teagle Hall](http://bit.ly/2hfNhqD)'s gymnasium on the second floor. If you arrive
early and see the gymnastics team is still using the gymnasium, please wait
outside for them to finish.

Club members are additionally eligible for additional classes at [Finger Lakes
Aikido](http://www.fingerlakesaikido.com/) free of charge!
