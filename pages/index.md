# Welcome!
The Cornell Aikido Club offers Aikido instruction and training for all levels.
New members are accepted year-round! If you are new to Aikido or just want to
brush up on the basics, the club offers a beginner's class at the beginning of
every fall semester.

During the school year, our practice times are:

- Tuesday and Thursday 7:00 - 8:30 pm
- Saturday and Sunday 12:30 - 2:00 pm<s></s>

However, please check the [announcements](#announcements) below for irregular hours and
schedule changes.

Classes are held in [Teagle Hall](https://www.cornell.edu/about/maps/?loc=Teagle%20Hall)'s
gymnasium on the second floor. Please arrive 5 minutes early to help set up the
room and warm up. If you arrive even earlier and see the gymnastics team is
still using the gymnasium, please wait outside for them to finish.

Additionally, club members are eligible for classes at [Finger Lakes
Aikido](http://www.fingerlakesaikido.com/) free of charge!
