# Welcome
Due to the coronavirus, we're currently not having any in-person training. This may change later in the semester.

We are having some zoom classes to introduce people to training - doing things that are possible solo, in the spaces that people have at home. Feel free to email us about connecting for these sessions.

# Welcome!
The Cornell Aikido Club offers Aikido instruction and training for all levels.
New members are accepted year-round! If you are new to Aikido or just want to

- Sunday 12:30-2:00pm, Hinrichs Sensei, 2nd dan, and Cunha Sensei, 3rd dan

Please check the [announcements]({{ site.url }}/announcements) page for schedule changes over the summer and university breaks.

Classes are held in [Teagle Hall](https://www.cornell.edu/about/maps/?loc=Teagle%20Hall){:target="_blank"}'s
gymnasium on the second floor.

<!-- Please arrive 5 minutes early to help set up the
room and warm up. If you arrive even earlier and see the gymnastics team is
still using the gymnasium, please wait outside for them to finish.

Additionally, club members are eligible for classes at [Finger Lakes
Aikido](http://www.fingerlakesaikido.com/){:target="_blank”}, free of charge.
